## Go Syntax Reminder

As someone who often forgets how to create arrays while writing code,
I created this repository not to always search "How to create arrays in Go programming language" when writing small programs with Go.

Most of the code snippets you will see are [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1), [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) and samples I have coded myself.

You can also find several links that I plan to read or read, and the resources I use as a reference while studying Go is in ["references.md"](https://github.com/ozbekburak/go-syntax-reminder/blob/master/references.md)
